# ICDE-JobHive

## Problem Statement
Finding a job in today's market is incredibly challenging, especially for new graduates who do not have professional working experience. Due to several layoffs, the job market has decreased, leaving fewer opportunities available. Job seekers typically want to secure the best positions for themselves, but they frequently have difficulties matching their education and experience to the demands of the job market. Their abilities and the requirements of the work are incompatible, which makes the job search process difficult. As candidates struggle to discover jobs that properly match their abilities, the process gets discouraging, leading to a sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction. Additionally, there is strong competition among job searchers, which makes it even more difficult to get a job.<br><br>
To address these challenges, our project aims to create a website allowing job seekers to input their skills and preferences, which will be recorded in a database with their search criteria. With the help of ICDE and a web crawler, it will scan it all over the internet find real-time job listings and extract relevant job postings based on the qualifications and criteria provided by job seekers. With all this information, our system will make a personalized list of job options for each job seeker who has registered on the site. As a result, they won't have to waste hours looking through positions that don't fit their personal interests or skill set. Simultaneously, employers will find it easier to discover qualified candidates, making the hiring process more effective.
